My ambition is to create immersive and thought-provoking game worlds that blend
realism with deep storytelling. I aspire to design experiences that challenge playersâ€™
perspectives, whether through ultra-realistic post-apocalyptic settings, engaging tabletop
mechanics, or innovative AR interactions. My goal is to push the boundaries of game
design, crafting narratives and mechanics that leave a lasting impact on players while 
addressing real-world themes like environmental issues, societal struggles, and moral 
dilemmas.
